# Data Wrtangling_1
Goal: Test if music streaming activity differs by weekday and city (Springfield vs. Shelbyville).

Data: Analyzed music_project_en.csv with user IDs, tracks, genres, timestamps, and locations.

Approach: Conducted EDA, cleaned data (duplicates/missing values), and tested hypotheses statistically.

Key Metrics: Compared listening frequency, peak times, and genre preferences between cities.

Tools: Used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn) for analysis and visualizations.

Insights: Identified trends like weekday/weekend activity shifts and city-specific genre biases.

Outcome: Accepted/rejected hypothesis based on statistical evidence (e.g., t-tests, plots).

Impact: Findings can optimize music recommendations or targeted promotions.

Documentation: Detailed Jupyter Notebook with code, annotations, and conclusions.

Future Steps: Expand analysis to more cities or incorporate user demographics.

Achievement: Delivered data-driven insights to validate behavioral differences. ðŸŽ§ðŸ“ˆ
